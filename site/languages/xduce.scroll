* XDuce is a statically typed programming language for XML processing. Its basic data values are XML documents, and its types (so-called regular expression types) directly correspond to document schemas. XDuce also provides a flexible form of regular expression pattern matching, integrating conditional branching, tag checking, and subtree extraction, as well as dynamic typechecking. We survey the principles of XDuceâ€™s design, develop examples illustrating its key features, describe its foundations in the theory of regular tree automata, and present a complete formal definition of its core, along with a proof of type safety.
